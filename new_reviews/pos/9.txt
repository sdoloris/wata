A divine blend of natural and supernatural, fantasy and actuality, “Sicilian Ghost Story” reflects the horrors of a Mafia kidnapping through the prism of first love.

Shadowing Giuseppe (Gaetano Fernandez), a handsome teen from a wealthy family, into the woods one sunlit afternoon, young Luna (Julia Jedlikowska) stares, entranced, as butterflies float on Giuseppe’s fingers and small woodland animals scurry at their feet. Her parents warn her not to see him, muttering darkly about a problematic father, but Luna is in love. And when Giuseppe misses school and is absent from his forbiddingly shuttered home, Luna refuses to abandon a search that the villagers seem strangely unwilling to pursue.

Interspersing Luna’s quest with scenes of Giuseppe’s torment, the writers and directors, Fabio Grassadonia and Antonio Piazza (whose 2014 feature, “Salvo,” was similarly resistant to classification), flip the tone from bucolic to brutal with distressing ease. Water plops from the sweating stones of a dank underground cavern where Luna’s mother takes regular saunas (the wonderful sound design is by Guillaume Sciamá), and a mysterious lake waits ominously to link the living and the dead.
